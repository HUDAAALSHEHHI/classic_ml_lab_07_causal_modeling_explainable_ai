# Causal Modeling for Explainable AI

This experiment demonstrates how to use **causal inference** to understand the **true effect of one variable on another**, beyond simple correlations.  
It focuses on a practical business scenario:
- **Ad_Spend → Traffic → Sales**

The experiment compares:
1. **Causal analysis** using **DoWhy** to estimate the true effect of advertising on sales.  
2. **Traditional predictive modeling** using **Linear Regression** to highlight the difference between prediction and causation.
